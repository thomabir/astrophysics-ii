<h1 id="cosmological-background">Cosmological Background</h1>
<h2 id="cosmological-principle">Cosmological Principle</h2>
<p>The Cosmological principle states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales (larger than   100 ). This is a generalization of the Copernican principle, according to which there is no special place and no special direction in the universe.</p>
<p>In the following the evolution of the universe will be described, assuming that it is isotropic and homogeneous. Later local perturbations about this uniform background will be taken into account.</p>
<h2 id="elements-of-general-relativity">Elements of General Relativity</h2>
<p>The theoretical basis of cosmology is General Relativity (GR). In contrary to Newton’s laws, where a body is attracted by another one. In GR gravity is seen as a manifestation of the curvature of space-time and this curvature leads among others to the observation that bodies attract each other. The curvature of space-time is described by a metric <span class="math inline">\(g_{\mu\nu}\)</span> which describes the motion of distance on a curved space.</p>
<p>As an illustration we consider a two-dimensional space with a coordinate system <span class="math inline">\(x^\mu\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mu =\)</span> 1, 2. The physical square distance is then <span class="math inline">\(ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu} \mathrm{d}x^{\mu}\mathrm{d}x^{\nu}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}x^{\mu}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{d}x^{\nu}\)</span> are the coordinate distances. Assuming that the space is homogeneous and isotropic the distance can be written as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	ds^2 = a^2 (\frac{\mathrm{d}r^2}{1-kr^2} + r^2 \mathrm{d}\phi^2)\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> describes the curvature and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the length scale known as the scale factor which can also be time-dependent. If the scale factor is time dependent this means that the surface is uniformly expanding or contracting. The curvature <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for a homogeneous and isotropic surface is either <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> = 0 for a plane, <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> = 1 for a sphere or the curvature is negative <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> = -1 for a hyperbolic surface. In order to describe the sphere the coordinate transformation <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(sin\chi\)</span> is used and to describe the hyperbolic surface <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(sinh\chi\)</span>.</p>
<p>The discussion of the two-dimensional space can be adapted to our universe, which is in four dimensional space-time described by the Minkowsky metric <span class="math inline">\(g_{\mu\nu} = \diag(1, -1, -1, -1)\)</span>. In this space time the physical square distance for a flat universe would be given by <span class="math inline">\(ds^2 = c^2\mathrm{d}t^2- (\mathrm{d}x^2 + \mathrm{d}y^2 + \mathrm{d}z^2)\)</span>. In general the dynamics of space-time is described by the Einstein field equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{\rho} T_{\mu\nu}.\end{aligned}\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(G_{\mu\nu}\)</span> is the Einstein tensor, which includes the curvature of the space-time. <span class="math inline">\(T_{\mu\nu}\)</span> is the stress energy tensor and describes the content of the space-time. For an ideal fluid the stress energy tensor is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	T_{\mu\nu} = \diag(\rho c^2, p, p, p),\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\rho c^2\)</span> is the energy density and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> the pressure.</p>
<p>In the space-time the trajectories of particles are in geodesics which means they take the straightest paths possible. As an example for photons (massless particles) <span class="math inline">\(ds^2 = 0\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="frw-metric">FRW metric</h2>
<p>The Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric is the metric of a homogeneous and isotropic universe: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
  \dd{s}^2 = c^2 \dd{t}^2 - a(t)^2( \dd{\chi}^2 + r(\chi)^2 \dd{\Omega}^2 )\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>: comoving radius</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\dd{\Omega}^2 = \dd{\theta}^2 + \sin^2\theta \dd{\phi}^2\)</span>: solid angle element</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a(t)\)</span>: scale factor</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle
		r(\chi) = f_K(\chi) = 
		\begin{cases}
			\sin \chi &amp; \text{closed case, positive curvature}\\
			\chi &amp; \text{flat case}\\
			\sinh \chi &amp; \text{open case, negative curvature}
		\end{cases}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="hubble-parameter" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Hubble parameter</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Hubble parameter: <span class="math inline">\(H \mathrel{\vcenter{\baselineskip 0.5ex \lineskiplimit 0pt
			\hbox{\scriptsize.}\hbox{\scriptsize.}}}%
	=\dot{a}/a\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>today’s value gets a subscript zero: <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Because it is hard to measure <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> accurately, we write it as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		H_0 = 100 h \frac{\si{\km}}{\si{\s \mega\parsec}},
	\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(h \approx 0.7\)</span> is the dimensionless Hubble parameter.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(H_0^{-1} \approx \SI{10}{\giga\year}\)</span> is about the age of the universe</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(c H_0^{-1} \approx \SI{4}{\giga \parsec}\)</span> is about the size of the observable universe</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sec:Friedmann">Friedmann equation</h2>
<p>The Friedmann equations are derived by plugging the FRW metric into Einstein’s equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	H^2 &amp;= \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{K c^2}{a^2}\\
	\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} &amp;= \frac{4 \pi G}{3} \left( \rho + \frac{3 p}{c^2} \right)\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The critical density is defined as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\rho_\text{crit}(t) = \frac{3 H(t)^2}{8 \pi G}\end{aligned}\]</span> Today, the critical density is about five hydrogen atoms per cubic metre, or one galaxy per .</p>
<p>Density parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The subscript <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> describes one component of the universe (<span class="math inline">\(i =\)</span> radiation, dark matter, matter )</p></li>
<li><p>density parameter: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_i(t) = \rho_i(t)/\rho_\text{crit}(t)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>total energy density: <span class="math inline">\(\rho(t) = \sum_{i} \rho_i(t)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>total density parameter: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(t) = \rho(t)/\rho_\text{crit}(t)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>curvature density parameter: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{K,0} = 1 - \Omega_0 = - Kc^2/H_0^2 a_0^2\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>With these definitions, the (first) Friedmann equation can be rewritten as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{H}{H_0} = \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{\rho_{\text{crit}, 0}} + \Omega_{K,0} \left( \frac{a_0}{a} \right)^2 }\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>
<p>To solve the Friedmann equation, <span class="math inline">\(\rho(t)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\rho(a)\)</span> need to be known. It can be calculated as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\rho = n \epsilon\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the particle number per unit volume and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> the energy per particle</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Relativistic matter. <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is constant with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(n \propto a^{-3}\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\rho \propto a^{-3}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Radiation. <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = h \nu = h c / \lambda \propto a^{-1}\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(\rho \propto a^{-4}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Vacuum energy is constant in <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a generalization for general fluids:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>equation of state: <span class="math inline">\(p = w p c^2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>density: <span class="math inline">\(\rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle w = 
	\begin{cases}
	0 &amp; \text{matter}\\
	1/3 &amp; \text{radiation}\\
	-1 &amp; \text{vacuum energy}
	\end{cases}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The results can be plugged into the Friedmann equation: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{H}{H_0} 
	&amp;= \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{\rho_{\text{crit}, 0}} + \Omega_{K,0} \left( \frac{a_0}{a} \right)^2 }\\

		+ \Omega_{K,0} \left( \frac{a_0}{a} \right)^2
	}\end{aligned}\]</span> This is a differential equation with <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{i,0}\)</span> as parameters.</p>
<p>The standard cosmological model:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{m,0} \approx 0.3\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{r,0} \approx 10^{-5}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\Lambda,0} \approx 0.7\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{K,0} \approx 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Omega_0 \approx 1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(h \approx 0.7\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>At different times, the universe is dominated by different components. Approximations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Matter dominated: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		\frac{H}{H_0} = \sqrt{\Omega_{m,0} \left( \frac{a_0}{a}\right)^3}

<li><p>Radiation dominated: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		\frac{H}{H_0} = \sqrt{\Omega_{r,0} \left( \frac{a_0}{a} \right)^4}

<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> dominated: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

<h2 id="distances-and-times">Distances and times</h2>
<h3 id="angular-distance-luminosity-distance">Angular distance &amp; Luminosity distance</h3>
<p>The comoving distance <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> and the proper distance <span class="math inline">\(a \chi\)</span> to a source are not directly observable. However, the angular size <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and the flux <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> of an object can be measured directly.</p>
<p>Intrinsic properties of the source:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>its size <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>its luminosity <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Properties of space-time:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the comoving distance to the source <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>the proper distance to the source <span class="math inline">\(a(t) \chi\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Measurable quantities for an observer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the angular size <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>the flux <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In Euclidean space, the following relations hold: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\theta &amp;= \frac{D}{d}
	&amp; F &amp;= \frac{L}{4 \pi d^2}\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the distance to the source. In FRW-space, we define the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the angular-diameter distance <span class="math inline">\(d_A\)</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\theta = D/d_A\)</span>. One can show <span class="math inline">\(d_A = a r(\chi)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>the luminosity distance <span class="math inline">\(d_L\)</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">\(F = L/4\pi d_L^2\)</span>. One can show that <span class="math inline">\(d_L = r(\chi)/a\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="comoving-radius">Comoving radius</h3>
<p>We measured the redshift of a photon that has travelled to us on a radial trajectory. How far away (in comoving distance) is the source? <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	0 &amp;= \dd{s}^2 &amp;&amp;\text{photon}\\
	&amp;= c \dd{t}^2 - a(t)^2 [\dd{\chi}^2 + r(\chi)^2 \dd{\Omega}^2] &amp;&amp;\text{FRW metric}\\
	\implies c \dd{t} &amp;= a(t) \dd{\chi} &amp;&amp;\dd{\Omega}^2 = 0 \text{ on a radial trajectory}\\
	\implies \dd{\chi} &amp;= \frac{c \dd{t}}{a(t)}\\
	&amp;= \frac{c \dd{a}}{a^2 H(a)} &amp;&amp; H = \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \text{, so } \dd{t} = \frac{\dd{a}}{a H(a)}\\
	\implies \chi(a) &amp;= c \int_a^{a_0} \frac{\dd{a&#39;}}{a&#39;^2 H(a&#39;)} &amp;&amp; \chi(a_0) = 0\end{aligned}\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(H(a)\)</span> has to be obtained from the Friedmann equations. As a result, we will get <span class="math inline">\(\chi(a,a_0)\)</span>. We can use <span class="math inline">\(a/a_0 = 1/(1+z)\)</span> to get <span class="math inline">\(\chi(z,a_0)\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> can be defined arbitrarily (for example, <span class="math inline">\(a_0=1\)</span>), we get <span class="math inline">\(\chi(z)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="comoving-horizon">Comoving Horizon</h3>
<p>Suppose a (hypothetical, non-interacting) photon was emitted at the Big Bang. How far (in comoving distance) could it have travelled until now? This comoving distance is called the comoving horizon. We plug into the previous equation, with <span class="math inline">\(a=0\)</span> at the start: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\chi(a)
	&amp;= c \int_0^{a_0} \frac{\dd{a&#39;}}{a&#39;^2 H(a&#39;)}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="age-of-the-universe">Age of the Universe</h3>
<p>How old is the universe? <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	t_0 &amp;= \int_0^{t_0} \dd{t}\\
	&amp;= \int_0^{a_0} \frac{\dd{a}}{a H(a)} &amp;&amp; H(a) = \dot{a}/a\end{aligned}\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(H(a)\)</span> is again found from the Friedmann equation. With the standard cosmology, <span class="math inline">\(t_0 \approx \SI{14}{\giga\year}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="sec:thermal-history">Thermal history</h2>
<p>According to the Big Bang paradigm, the universe was once hot and dense, and now it expands and cools down. Today, it is far from thermal equilibrium, but it must have been in thermal equilibrium at some point in the past if it continuously expands.</p>
<p>A system is in thermal equilibrium if <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma \gg H\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Gamma = \text{interactions}/\text{time}\)</span> is the interaction rate</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(H = \dot{a}/a\)</span> is the Hubble constant</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, a system is in thermal equilibrium if <span class="math inline">\(\tau_\Gamma \ll \tau_H\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\tau_\Gamma = 1/\Gamma\)</span> is the characteristic timescale of interactions</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\tau_H = 1/H\)</span> is the characteristic timescale of expansion</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We already know about <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is defined as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Gamma = n v \sigma\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n \quad\)</span> number density, <span class="math inline">\(\text{particles}/\text{volume}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(v \quad\)</span> velocity of particles</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sigma \quad\)</span> scattering cross-section, has units of area.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At early times, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma \gg H\)</span>. Particles are in thermal equilibrium with the plasma and coupled to photons. This scenario will be treated in <a href="#ssec:early-times" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ssec:early-times">1.8.1</a>.</p>

<h2 id="thermodynamics">Thermodynamics</h2>
<p>To describe the evolution of the universe quantitatively, a few definitions are required:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The probability that a particle is in a volume <span class="math inline">\(\dd{^3 x} \dd{^3 p}\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is given by the <strong>(phase space) distribution function</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		f(\symbf{x}, \symbf{p}, t) \dd{^3 x} \dd{^3 p}
	\end{aligned}\]</span> In a homogeneous and isotropic universe, we have <span class="math inline">\(f(\symbf{x}, \symbf{p}, t) = f(p, t)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of particles per unit volume is given by the <strong>number density</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		n(t) = 4\pi \int f(p,t) p^2  \dd{p}
	\end{aligned}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The energy per unit volume is given by the <strong>energy density</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		\rho(t) = 4 \pi \int E(p) f(p,t) p^2 \dd{p},
	\end{aligned}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(E(p) = \sqrt{p^2 + m^2}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>pressure</strong> is given by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		P(t) = 4 \pi c^2 \int \frac{p^2}{3 E(p)} f(p,t) p^2 \dd{p}
	\end{aligned}\]</span> Since we work in natural units, we drop the <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ssec:early-times">At early times (<span class="math inline">\(\Gamma &gt; H\)</span>)</h3>
<p>The distribution function of particles in thermodynamic equilibrium is the Bose-Einstein or the Fermi-Dirac distribution: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	f_\text{eq}(p,t)
	= \frac{g}{(2\pi)^3} \left[ \exp\left( 
		\frac{E(p)-\mu}{T} \pm 1
	 \right) \right]^{-1}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> is for fermions and <span class="math inline">\(-\)</span> for bosons</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is a spin degeneracy factor. Examples: <span class="math inline">\(g_\nu = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g_\gamma = 2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g_\text{quark} = 6\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the chemical potential, which is the response of a thermodynamics system to a change of particle number. Usually, <span class="math inline">\(\mu=0\)</span> for our purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is the temperature of the universe, which is time dependent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For <em>non-relativistic particles</em>, <span class="math inline">\(T \ll m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E \approx m + p^2/2m\)</span>. Plugging this in yields <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	n &amp;= g \left( \frac{m T}{2 \pi} \right)^{3/2} \exp\left( \frac{p-m}{T} \right)&amp;
	\rho &amp;= n m&amp;
	P &amp;= n T\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>For <em>relativistic particles</em>, <span class="math inline">\(T \gg m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E \approx p\)</span>. For both fermions and bosons, this yields <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	n &amp;= g T^3&amp;
	\rho &amp;= g T^4&amp;
	P &amp;= \frac{\rho}{3}\end{aligned}\]</span> In the case of a relativistic gas, <span class="math inline">\(T \propto a^{-1}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(n \propto a^{-3}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho \propto a^{-4}\)</span>. This is what we have already seen in <a href="#sec:Friedmann" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:Friedmann">1.4</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ssec:late-times">At late times (<span class="math inline">\(\Gamma &lt; H\)</span>)</h3>
<p>The transition between non-equilibrium and equilibrium takes place at the decoupling time of freeze-out time <span class="math inline">\(t_f\)</span>. At <span class="math inline">\(t&gt;t_f\)</span>, the transition function is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	f(p,t) = f\left( p \frac{a(t)}{a(t_f)}, t_f \right)\end{aligned}\]</span> The shape of the function is “frozen in” at the freeze-out time <span class="math inline">\(t_f\)</span>.</p>
<p>For a relativistic particle, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	f(p,t) =
	 \frac{g}{(2\pi)^3} \left[ \exp\left( 
		\frac{p a(t)}{T_f a(t_f)} \pm 1
	 	\right) \right]^{-1},\end{aligned}\]</span> which is the same as for an equilibrium particle, but with <span class="math inline">\(T_f \mathrel{\vcenter{\baselineskip 0.5ex \lineskiplimit 0pt

	=T_f a(t_f)/a(t)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="ssec:boltzmann">Boltzmann equation</h3>
<p>The Boltzmann equation <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dv{f_i}{t} = c_i[f_i]\end{aligned}\]</span> describes the time evolution of the distribution function. <span class="math inline">\(c_i[f_i]\)</span> is the collision term.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> only depends on <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, so we can write <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dv{f_i}{t} &amp;= \pdv{f_i}{t} + \pdv{f_i}{p} \pdv{p}{t}\end{aligned}\]</span> The last term can be simplified. Because <span class="math inline">\(p = p_0 a^{-1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\dv*{p}{t} = -p_0 a^{-1} \dot{a} = - p H\)</span>. The Boltzmann equation then becomes <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\pdv{f_i}{t} - p H(t) \pdv{f_i}{p} &amp;= c_i[f_i]\\
	\implies \pdv{}{t} \int \dd{^3 p} f_i - H(t) \int \dd{^3 p} p \pdv{f_i}{p} &amp;= \int \dd{^3 p} c_i[f_i]\\
	\implies \dv{n_i}{t} + 3 H(t) n_i &amp;= \int \dd{^3 p} c_i[f_i]\end{aligned}\]</span> In the last line, we used partial integration. If the system is collisionless, <span class="math inline">\(c_i[f_i]=0\)</span>, and the solution of the Boltzmann equation is <span class="math inline">\(n_i \propto a^{-3}\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(3H(t) n_i\)</span> is called the Hubble drag term.</p>
<p>We now look at reactions of the type <span class="math inline">\(i + j \leftrightarrow a + b\)</span>. The collision term is then of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	c_i[f_i] = \alpha(T) n_a n_b - \beta(T) n_i n_j\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha(T)\)</span> is the production rate</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\beta(T)\)</span> is the destruction rate</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To simplify the equation, we make a few assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are in equilibrium with a general plasma at temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n_i = n_j\)</span> (this is the case for antiparticles)</p></li>
<li><p>radiation era: <span class="math inline">\(a \propto t^{1/2} \propto T^{-1}\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The equation is then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dv{n_i}{t} + 3 H(t) n_i = \beta(T) (n_{i, \text{eq}}^2 - n_i^2)\end{aligned}\]</span> To analyse the equation, we define</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x = m_i/T\)</span> is used as a time variable</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(y_i = n_i/S\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the entropy</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(x) = n_{i, \text{eq}}(x) \beta(x)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The equation is then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{x}{y_{i, \text{eq}}} \dv{y_i}{x} = - \frac{\Gamma(x)}{H(x)} \left[ \left( \frac{y_i}{y_{i,\text{eq}}} \right)^2 - 1 \right]\end{aligned}\]</span> Initial conditions: <span class="math inline">\(x \ll 1\)</span> at early times, so <span class="math inline">\(y_i = y_{i, \text{eq}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>No analytical solution is known. A set of numerical solutions is shown in <a href="#fig:boltzmann" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:boltzmann">[fig:boltzmann]</a></p>

<p><img src="img/ch-02/boltzmann.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h2 id="particle-relics">Particle relics</h2>
<p>There are two types of relics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hot relics freeze out when the particles are still relativistic. Since <span class="math inline">\(x = m_i / T\)</span>, this means <span class="math inline">\(x_f \ll 1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Cold relics freeze out when the particles are already non-relativistic, with <span class="math inline">\(x_f \gg 1\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hot-relics">Hot relics</h3>
<p>Hot relics are still relativistic today, so their rest mass is <span class="math inline">\(m_i \ll T_0 = \SI{2.4e-4}{\eV}\)</span>. An example would be massless neutrinos.</p>
<p>The solution of the Boltzmann equation is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		\Omega_{i,0} h^2
		&amp;= \frac{ g_{i,\text{eff}} }{2}  \left[ \frac{g_{*s}(x_0)}{g_{*s}(x_f)} \right]^{4/3} \Omega_{\gamma, 0} h^2
	\end{aligned}\]</span> The <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>’s are degeneracy factors and satisfy <span class="math inline">\(g_{*s}(x_0) \leq g_{*s}(x_f)\)</span>, and the photon density is <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\gamma,0} h^2 = \num{2.5e-5}\)</span>. It follows that <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{i,0}\)</span> is very small, which means that hot relic particles contribute very little to today’s energy density.</p>
<h3 id="wimps">WIMPs</h3>
<p>Next we consider weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Examples are massive neutrinos and stable, light supersymmetric particles. WIMPs can either be hot (<span class="math inline">\(x_f \ll 1\)</span>) or cold (<span class="math inline">\(x_f \gg 1\)</span>).</p>
<h4 id="hot-wimps">Hot WIMPs</h4>
<p>The solution of the Boltzmann equation yields <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Omega_{i,0} h^2 = \num{7.64e-2} 
	\left( \frac{g_{i,\text{eff}}}{g_{*s}(x_f)} \right)
	\frac{m_i}{\si{\eV}}\end{aligned}\]</span> Since we know that <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{i,0} &lt; 1\)</span>, we can get a constraint <span class="math inline">\(m_i &lt; \SI{100}{\eV}\)</span> on the mass of the hot WIMPs, which is possible for neutrinos. However, hot WIMPs are ruled out as dark matter by structure formation arguments.</p>
<h4 id="cold-wimps">Cold WIMPs</h4>
<p>Boltzmann says <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Omega_{i,0} h^2
	&amp;= \begin{cases}
	1.8 \left( \frac{m_i}{\si{\GeV}} \right)^{-2} 
	\left[ 1 + 0.17 \ln\left( \frac{m_i}{\si{\GeV}} \right) \right]
	&amp; \text{if } m_i &lt; \SI{100}{\GeV}\\
	\left( \frac{m_i}{\SI{3}{\TeV}} \right)^2
	&amp; \text{if } m_i &gt; \SI{100}{\GeV}
	\end{cases}\end{aligned}\]</span> To get <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{i,0} &lt; 1\)</span>, we need <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span> to be between <span class="math inline">\(\SI{1.4}{\GeV}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\SI{3}{\TeV}\)</span>. Cold Wimps are good candidates for dark matter.</p>
<h2 id="primordial-nucleosynthesis">Primordial nucleosynthesis</h2>
<p>This is the epoch where protons and neutrons first combined to nuclei (not atoms) heavier than hydrogen. Heavier atoms can also be synthesized in stars through nuclear reactions, which has to be differentiated in observations.</p>
<h3 id="initial-conditions" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Initial conditions</h3>
<p>Initially, the temperature is <span class="math inline">\(T &lt; \SI{e13}{\kelvin}\)</span> and the associated energy scale is <span class="math inline">\(k_B T \approx \SI{0.8}{\MeV}\)</span>. Protons and neutrons are in thermal equilibrium and interact weakly via the processes <span class="math inline">\(p + e \leftrightarrow n + \nu_e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n + \bar{e} \leftrightarrow p + \bar{\nu}_e\)</span>. Since the mass of the nucleons is around 940 MeV, they are already non-relativistic. The masses of neutrons and protons are slightly different, so their abundances after freeze out are different.</p>
<h3 id="nuclear-reactions" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Nuclear reactions</h3>
<p>Once the temperature drops below 1 MeV, which is the binding energy of a typical nucleus, the nuclei start forming. A host of nuclear reactions can occur then: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\ce{p + n &amp;&lt;=&gt; \gamma{} + D} &amp;
	\ce{D + n &amp;&lt;=&gt; \gamma{} + ^3H} \\
	\ce{D + D &amp;&lt;=&gt; p + ^3H} &amp;
	\ce{D + p &amp;&lt;=&gt; \gamma{} + ^3He} \\
	\ce{D + D &amp;&lt;=&gt; n + ^3He} &amp;
	\ce{^3H + p &amp;&lt;=&gt; n + ^3He} \\
	\ce{^3H &amp;&lt;=&gt; e + \bar{\nu}_e + ^3He} &amp;
	\ce{^3H + p &amp;&lt;=&gt; \gamma{} + ^4He} \\
	\ce{^3H + D &amp;&lt;=&gt; n + ^4He} &amp; 
	\ce{^3He + n &amp;&lt;=&gt; \gamma{} + ^4He} \\
	\ce{^3He + D &amp;&lt;=&gt; p + ^4He} &amp;
	\ce{2 ^3He &amp;&lt;=&gt; 2p + ^4He} \\
	\ce{^7Li + p &amp;&lt;=&gt; 2 ^4He} &amp;
	\ce{^4He + ^3H &amp;&lt;=&gt; \gamma{} + ^7Li} \\
	\ce{^4He + ^3He &amp;&lt;=&gt; \gamma{} + ^7Be} &amp;
	\ce{^7Be + e &amp;&lt;=&gt; \nu_e + ^7Li}\end{aligned}\]</span> For each of these reactions, there is a Boltzmann equation which describes the evolution of the number densities. This coupled system of equations can be solved numerically to find the abundances of nuclei. The solution for a few nuclei is shown in <a href="#fig:nucleosynthesis" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:nucleosynthesis">[fig:nucleosynthesis]</a>.</p>

<p><img src="img/ch-02/nucleosynthesis.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h2 id="recombination">Recombination</h2>
<p>As the universe cools down to a temperature that is lower than the binding energy of hydrogen (<span class="math inline">\(\SI{13.6}{\eV}\)</span>), some hydrogen atoms start to form via the reaction <span class="math inline">\(p + e \to H + \gamma\)</span>. This epoch is called recombination, even though electrons and protons combine for the first time. Other atoms also start forming, but we only care about hydrogen for now.s</p>
<p>The ionization fraction <span class="math inline">\(x_e\)</span> is the ratio between the number density of electrons and the number density of baryons (protons, hydrogen): <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	x_e \mathrel{\vcenter{\baselineskip 0.5ex \lineskiplimit 0pt
			\hbox{\scriptsize.}\hbox{\scriptsize.}}}%
	=\frac{n_e}{n_b}\end{aligned}\]</span> For given initial conditions, the ionization fraction can be calculated as a function of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> by solving the Boltzmann equation, see <a href="#fig:ionization" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:ionization">[fig:ionization]</a></p>

<p><img src="img/ch-02/ionization.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h3 id="recombination-1">Recombination</h3>
<p>The time of recombination is defined as the time when there are ten times more baryons than electrons: <span class="math inline">\(x_e(z_\text{rec}) = 0.1\)</span>. This happens at a temperature of <span class="math inline">\(T_\text{rec} \approx \SI{0.3}{\eV}\)</span> and a redshift of <span class="math inline">\(z \approx 1300\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(T_\text{rec}\)</span> is smaller than the binding energy of hydrogen. This is because recombination is delayed by the high abundance of photons.</p>
<h3 id="decoupling">Decoupling</h3>
<p>The interaction of electrons and photons (in the relevant energy regime) is described by Thomson scattering, with a scattering cross-section of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_T = \SI{6.65e-25}{\cm\squared}\)</span>. The reaction rate is then (see <a href="#sec:thermal-history" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:thermal-history">1.7</a>) <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Gamma_T = n_e \sigma_T c,\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_e\)</span> is the number density of electrons, and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> the speed of photons. We know that strong coupling occurs as long as <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_T \gg H\)</span>, so we define the moment of decoupling such that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Gamma_T(z_\text{dec}) = H(z_\text{dec})\end{aligned}\]</span> This happens at <span class="math inline">\(z \approx 1100\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E \approx \SI{0.26}{\eV}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T \approx \SI{3000}{\kelvin}\)</span>, after the universe is 380000 old. Note that <span class="math inline">\(z_\text{dec} &lt; z_\text{rec}\)</span>, so decoupling occurs soon after recombination.</p>
<p>After decoupling, the universe is transparent to photons. When an observer today stares into empty space, the photons he measures come from the surface of last scattering, where the photons interacted for the last time during decoupling. This is the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which has a temperature of <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	T_\text{CMB} = T_\text{dec}\frac{a_0}{a_\text{dec}}
	\approx \SI{3}{\kelvin}\end{aligned}\]</span> Measurements of the CMB show a blackbody spectrum with remarkably deviations of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T / T \approx \num{e-5}\)</span>, as can be seen in <a href="#fig:cmb" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:cmb">[fig:cmb]</a>.</p>

<p><img src="img/ch-02/cmb.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h2 id="λcdm-model">ΛCDM model</h2>
<p>The ΛCDM model is a refinement of the Big Bang model, and it is the standard model of cosmology. Three observational pillars justify this model:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the expansion of the universe,</p></li>
<li><p>the big bang nucleosynthesis, and</p></li>
<li><p>the cosmic microwave background.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>According to ΛCDM, the energy content of the universe today is made up of radiation, matter, dark matter, and dark energy. Their contributions today are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Photons and neutrinos: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\gamma,0} \approx \Omega_{\nu,0}/0.68 \approx \num{2.5e-5} h^{-2}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Baryons: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{b,0} \approx 0.05\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Dark Matter: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{dm,0} \approx 0.25\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Dark Energy: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_\Lambda \approx 0.7\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>We now look at the constituents in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="radiation" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Radiation</h3>
<p>As radiation, we classify those particles that are still relativistic today. Accordingly, they need to have very low mass.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most photons are part of the CMB and haven a temperature <span class="math inline">\(T\approx \SI{2.73}{\kelvin}\)</span>. They contribute only very little to the energy density: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\gamma,0} = \num{2.5e-5}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Massless neutrinos contribute about the same as photons: <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\nu,0} = 0.68 \Omega_{\gamma,0} \approx \num{1.7e-5}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="baryons" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Baryons</h3>
<p>Baryons from the Big Bang nucleosynthesis contribute <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_b \approx 0.05\)</span>. They mostly occur in two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even though only ten percent of baryons are found in stars, they are the largest fraction of visible matter.</p></li>
<li><p>The rest of the baryons is in the form of various phases, such as cold gas, warm gas, and hot gas, both in the intergalactic and the interstellar medium.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dark-matter" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Dark Matter</h3>
<p>Dark Matter contributes <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_\text{dm} \approx 0.25\)</span>. We know of its existence through its gravitational effects. There is evidence for dark matter in galaxies, galaxy clusters, large scale structure, and many others.</p>
<p>Dark matter is mostly non-baryonic, because baryons are constrained to <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_b \approx 0.05\)</span> by Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Also, the structure formation constraints below rule out baryons as dark matter candidates.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dark matter is cold (non-relativistic). It is thus called Cold Dark Matter (CDM)</p></li>
<li><p>It interacts very weakly, so we can approximate it as non-collisional.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A good candidate for dark matter are particles beyond the standard model, such as WIMPs.</p>
<p>Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs), such as black holes, are not good candidates, since objects with masses from <span class="math inline">\(\num{e-6}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(15\, M_\odot\)</span> are ruled out.</p>
<h3 id="dark-energy" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Dark Energy</h3>
<p>Dark Energy contributes <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_\text{de} \approx 0.7\)</span>. It is needed to get a flat geometry for the universe, and to explain the recent acceleration of the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>From the first Friedmann equation, we know that a constant energy density results in a scale factor <span class="math inline">\(a \propto e^{Ht}\)</span> that is exponentially growing. Consider an effective fluid with equation of state <span class="math inline">\(p_\text{DE} = w \rho_\text{DE} c^2\)</span>. We demand <span class="math inline">\(\ddot{a} &gt; 0\)</span>, and the second Friedmann equation then yields <span class="math inline">\(w &lt; -1/3\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are a few possible candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The cosmological constant <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(w=-1\)</span>, independent of time.</p></li>
<li><p>A model called <em>quintessence</em>, which is a dynamical scalar field, would give rise to another form of energy. Since it is dynamical, you can map it to an effective fluid, with a <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> that varies in time.</p></li>
<li><p>There could be a theory of gravity that can improve upon or replace general relativity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Current constraints demand <span class="math inline">\(w = -1\)</span> with an uncertainty of about 5 %. The cosmological constant is thus a model that is consistent with observations, and it is part of the ΛCDM model.</p>
<h3 id="summary" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Summary</h3>
<p>In total, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_0 \approx 1\)</span>, so the universe has a flat geometry. The exact nature of dark energy and dark matter are some of the most pressing questions in fundamental physics.</p>
<p>There are other ingredients to ΛCDM, such as the model of gravity and the choice of initial conditions. A process called inflation is also added, as we will see later.</p>
<p>The ΛCMD model is very successful to fit current observations, but there are some tensions that are starting to emerge with more detailed measurements from cosmological probes.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-λcdm">Problems with ΛCDM</h2>
<p>The ΛCDM model without inflation has a few intrinsic fundamental problems.</p>
<h3 id="the-horizon-problem">The horizon problem</h3>
<p>We have defined the particle horizon <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\chi_h(t) = \int_0^t \frac{c \dd{t&#39;}}{a(t&#39;)},\end{aligned}\]</span> which is the maximal comoving distance that a photon could have travelled from the big bang (<span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>) until time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Let’s look at the size of the horizon at decoupling time, where photons scattered for the last time. This corresponds to a redshift <span class="math inline">\(z_\text{dec} \approx 1100\)</span>. The integral evaluates to <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\chi_h (t_\text{dec}) \approx 180 h^{-1} \, \si{\mega\parsec}\end{aligned}\]</span> The corresponding CMB angular scale is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\theta_h
	&amp;= \frac{\chi_h(t_\text{dec})}{r(\chi_\text{dec})} 
	\approx \SI{1.8}{\deg},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the comoving angular diameter distance. This is unexpected, because the CMB is extremely homogeneous across the whole sky, even though the photons from different areas of the sky could not have been in causal contact when they scattered! Something must be wrong here.</p>
<h3 id="flatness-problem">Flatness problem</h3>
<p>We have observationally determined <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_0 \approx 1\)</span>, so we have a flat geometry. Let’s look at how <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> varies with time. For this, we can use the Friemann equation: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	H(a)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho(a) - \frac{Kc^2}{a^2}\end{aligned}\]</span> We look at the deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{1 - \Omega(a)}{\Omega(a)}
	&amp;= \Omega(a)^{-1} - 1\\
	&amp;= -\frac{3Kc^2}{8\pi G \rho(a)a^2}\\
	&amp;\propto
	\begin{cases}
		a^2 &amp;\text{in the radiation era } \rho \propto a^{-4}\\
		a &amp; \text{in the matter era } \rho \propto a^{-3}
	\end{cases}\end{aligned}\]</span> Consider time <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> in the radiation era. Then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\Omega_i^{-1} - 1}{\Omega_0^{-1} - 1}
	&amp;= \frac{\Omega_i^{-1} - 1}{\Omega_\text{eq}^{-1} -1}
	\frac{\Omega_\text{eq}^{-1}-1}{\Omega_0^{-1}-1}\\
	&amp;= 
	\left( \frac{a_i}{a_\text{eq}} \right)^2 
	\left( \frac{a_\text{eq}}{a_0} \right)\\
	&amp;= \left( \frac{T_\text{eq}}{T_i} \right)^2
	\frac{T_0}{T_\text{eq}}
	&amp;&amp; T \propto a^{-1} \text{ for a relativistic gas}\end{aligned}\]</span> We choose the Planck time as our starting point: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	t_\text{init} &amp;= t_\text{Planck}
	\mathrel{\vcenter{\baselineskip 0.5ex \lineskiplimit 0pt
			\hbox{\scriptsize.}\hbox{\scriptsize.}}}%
	=
	\left( \frac{\hbar G}{c^5} \right)^{1/2}\\
	T_\text{Planck} &amp;= \SI{e32}{\kelvin}\\
	T_0 &amp;= \SI{3}{\kelvin}\\
	T_\text{eq} &amp;= \SI{e4}{\kelvin} \end{aligned}\]</span> Then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\Omega_\text{Planck}^{-1} - 1}{\Omega_0^{-1}-1} \approx \num{e-60}\end{aligned}\]</span> This means that any deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> at the Planck time has been amplified by <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span> orders of magnitude until today. This is also called the fine tuning problem, which requires <span class="math inline">\(\Omega=1\)</span> with extreme accuracy at early times. What is the physical explanation of this?</p>
<h3 id="monopole-problem">Monopole problem</h3>
<p>Consider <span class="math inline">\(T \approx \SI{e14}{\GeV}\)</span>, which was the case during the grand unification (GUT) epoch, where the fundamental forces were unified. At these temperatures, there is a phase transition. Before the transition, the forces are unified, and during the transition, there is a spontaneous symmetry breaking. A prediction for topological defects that happen during this transition requires that there should be magnetic monopoles with an enormous density <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\text{monopole},0} \approx \num{e11}\)</span>. If you still exist, this scenario is obviously ruled out by observations.</p>
<h3 id="structure-formation-problem">Structure formation problem</h3>
<p>Today, even though the cosmological principle holds for large distance scales (a few 100 M), we still see many structures on various smaller scales in the universe. What were the “seeds”, the initial perturbations that are responsible for the creation of these structures?</p>
<h3 id="initial-condition-problem">Initial condition problem</h3>
<p>All of these problems can be resolved by postulating very special and finely tuned initial conditions. These could arise from physics in the quantum gravity era. The benefit of the inflation model is that all these problems could be resolved without having to resort to quantum gravity.</p>
<h2 id="inflation">Inflation</h2>
<p>Inflation is a possible solution for the disparities that we have seen in the previous section. We will tackle them one by one from here.</p>
<h3 id="horizon-problem">Horizon problem</h3>
<p>We define two things two reformulate the horizon problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The size of the forward light cone: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		\chi_f = \int_0 ^{t_\text{ls}} \frac{c \dd{t&#39;}}{a(t&#39;)}
	\end{aligned}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The size of the past light cone: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		\chi_p = \int_{t_\text{ls}}^{t_0} \frac{c \dd{t&#39;}}{a(t&#39;)}
	\end{aligned}\]</span> This is the maximum comoving distance that photons could have travelled since last scattering.</p></li>
</ul>

Without inflation, the forward light cone (dashed line) would be smaller than our past light cone, <span class="math inline">\(\chi_p\)</span>, at the last scattering surface, resulting in causality problems. With a period of inflation from <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_e\)</span>, however, the forward light cone can be larger than the past light cone at <span class="math inline">\(t_\text{ls}\)</span>.<span label="fig:inflation"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The horizon problem can be stated mathematically as <span class="math inline">\(\chi_f&#39; &lt; \chi_p\)</span>: Regions which are observable today to have similar temperatures were apparently not in causal contact at last scattering. A solution is to increase <span class="math inline">\(\chi_f&#39;\)</span> through a period of accelerated expansion called inflation. A sketch of this is shown in <a href="#fig:inflation" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:inflation">[fig:inflation]</a>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_e\)</span> be the start and end time of inflation, with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t = t_e - t_i\)</span>. We know <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\chi_f = \chi_h(t_\text{ls})
	= \int_0^{t_\text{ls}} \frac{c \dd{t&#39;}}{a(t&#39;)}\end{aligned}\]</span> For vacuum energy, we know that <span class="math inline">\(\rho_\text{vac}(a)\)</span> is constant. We assume that, at early times, there was some kind of vacuum energy which gives us <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	a \propto e^{Ht} \text{ with } 
	H = \sqrt{8 \pi G \rho_\text{vac}/3} = \text{constant},\end{aligned}\]</span> exactly like our derivations for the cosmological constant. The contribution to <span class="math inline">\(\chi_f\)</span> during inflation is then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\chi_f(t_i,t_e)
	&amp;= \int_{t_i}^{t_e} \frac{c \dd{t&#39;}}{a(t&#39;)}\\
	&amp;\propto \frac{1}{H a(t_e)} (e^{H \Delta t} - 1)\end{aligned}\]</span> We see that <span class="math inline">\(\chi_f\)</span> grows exponentially during inflation. For how long does inflation have to last to solve our problems? We need <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t &gt; 60 H^{-1}\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(e^{H \Delta t} &lt; \num{e25}\)</span>, if we assume <span class="math inline">\(t_e \approx t_\text{GUT}\)</span>. We thus require <span class="math inline">\(a_e/a_i &gt; e^{60}\)</span>, or in other words, we need <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span> “<span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>-foldings”.</p>
<h3 id="flatness-problem-1">Flatness problem</h3>
<p>One can show that <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\Omega^{-1}(t_e)-1}{\Omega^{-1}(t_i)-1}
	= \frac{a(t_i)}{a(t_e)}
	&lt; \num{e-52}\end{aligned}\]</span> assuming <span class="math inline">\(60\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>-foldings. As a result, any curvature that was originally there gets flattened by inflation.</p>
<h3 id="monopole-problem-1">Monopole problem</h3>
<p>The monopoles are diluted by the expansion during inflation by a factor <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\left( \frac{a_e}{a_i} \right)^3 \approx \num{e78},\end{aligned}\]</span> so the monopole density after inflation is practically zero.</p>
<h3 id="structure-formation-problem-1">Structure formation problem</h3>
<p>As we will see later, inflation provides a mechanism to generate primordial fluctuations. Microscopic quantum fluctuations are turned into macroscopic classical fluctuations by the rapid expansion.</p>
<h3 id="initial-condition-problem-1">Initial condition problem</h3>
<p>Inflation avoids having to set finely tuned initial conditions, since they will be diluted by the expansion. Quantum gravity is not required to solve this problem.</p>
<h3 id="realization">Realization</h3>
<p>Inflation requires vacuum energy, which is realized as a scalar field <span class="math inline">\(\phi(\symbf{x}, t)\)</span>, called the <em>inflaton</em>. The potential of the scalar field is sketched in <a href="#fig:false-vacuum" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:false-vacuum">[fig:false-vacuum]</a>.</p>

<p><img src="img/ch-02/false-vacuum.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>During inflation, <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is in a false vacuum state at a local minimum or a flat part of the potential. During the end of inflation, <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> reaches the true vacuum state, which has a lower potential energy. This generates vacuum energy, which in turn drives accelerated expansion.</p>
<p>We impose a <em>slow roll condition</em>, which impedes the field from changing too quickly: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dot{\phi}^2 \ll V(\phi)\end{aligned}\]</span> There are several models, some of which are old inflation, new inflation, and chaotic inflation. There are many other models proposed, indicating that inflation is still an ongoing field of research.</p>
<h1 id="linear-perturbations">Linear Perturbations</h1>
<p>We now drop the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. In this chapter, we analyse small perturbations about the background, which can be handled with linear perturbation theory. These perturbations will lead to the structures that we observe today.</p>
<p>We are going to make a few approximations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The perturbations are sufficiently small to be treated by linear perturbation theory.</p></li>
<li><p>We ignore relativistic effects and use a Newtonian approximation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several ways to model this structure.</p>
<h2 id="ideal-fluid">Ideal Fluid</h2>
<p>First, we model the content of the universe as an expanding, self-gravitating, ideal fluid in the Newtonian approximation. We consider the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>density <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\symbf{x},t)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>pressure <span class="math inline">\(p(\symbf{x},t)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>velocity <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{u}(\symbf{x},t) = \dot{\symbf{r}}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>gravitational potential <span class="math inline">\(\phi(\symbf{x},t)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The time evolution of these parameters is described by the <em>fluid equations</em>: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	
	\frac{\mathrm{D}\rho}{\mathrm{D}t}
 &amp;= - \rho \symbf{\nabla}_r \cdot \symbf{u}
	&amp;&amp; \text{continuity equation, conservation of mass}\\
	
	\frac{\mathrm{D}\symbf{u}}{\mathrm{D}t}
 &amp;= - \frac{\symbf{\nabla}_r p}{\rho} - \symbf{\nabla}_r \phi
	&amp;&amp;\text{acceleration} = \text{pressure force} + \text{gravitational force}\\
	\laplacian_r \phi &amp;= 4 \pi G \rho
	&amp;&amp;\text{Poisson equation}\end{aligned}\]</span> We define the <em>convective derivative</em> <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	
	\frac{\mathrm{D}}{\mathrm{D}t}
 = \pdv{}{t} + \symbf{u} \cdot \symbf{\nabla}_r,\end{aligned}\]</span> which is the time derivative as one moves along fluid elements.</p>
<h3 id="assumptions" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Assumptions</h3>
<p>Let’s consider the case where the fluid is expanding. In order to describe this, we can write the position vector as <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{r} = a(t) \symbf{x}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{x}\)</span> is a comoving coordinate. In the Newtonian treatment, we assume that the scale factor is a known input for the calculation. Then the (total) velocity is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\symbf{u} = \dot{a}(t) \symbf{x} + \symbf{v},\end{aligned}\]</span> where the first term is the Hubble expansion, and <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{v} = a \dot{\symbf{x}}\)</span> is the peculiar velocity.</p>
<p>We write the density as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\rho(\symbf{x},t) = \bar{\rho}(t) [1 + \delta(\symbf{x}, t)],\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\rho}(t) \propto a^{-3}\)</span> is the mean background density, and <span class="math inline">\(\delta(\symbf{x}, t)\)</span> is a small density perturbation.</p>
<p>We can plug these assumptions and definitions into the fluid equations to get <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\pdv{\delta}{t} + \frac{1}{a} \symbf{\nabla}\cdot[(1+\delta)\symbf{v}]
	&amp;= 0\\
	\pdv{\symbf{v}}{t} + \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \symbf{v} + \frac{1}{a} [\symbf{v} \cdot \symbf{\nabla}] \symbf{v}
	&amp;= - \frac{\symbf{\nabla}\Phi}{a} - \frac{\symbf{\nabla}p}{a \bar{\rho}(1+\delta)}\\
	\laplacian\Phi
	&amp;= 4 \pi G \bar{\rho} a^2 \delta\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Phi = \phi + \frac{1}{2} a \ddot{a} x^2 \end{aligned}\]</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{\nabla}= \symbf{\nabla}_{\symbf{x}}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="thermodynamics-1" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Thermodynamics</h3>
<p>We have three equations in four unknowns, so we still need the equation of state, which relates pressure to other variables, such as density and entropy.</p>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics states that internal energy can either be added by the means of heat or work: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dd{U} = \dd{Q} + \dd{W}\end{aligned}\]</span> We can use <span class="math inline">\(\dd{W} = - p \dd{V}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dd{Q} = T \dd{S}\)</span>. From now on, we assume we are dealing with an ideal gas. The equation of state for an ideal gas is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	p
	&amp;= n k_B T\\
	&amp;= \frac{\rho}{\mu m_p} k_B T\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the mean molecular weight and <span class="math inline">\(n = N/V\)</span> is the number density. The internal energy is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	U
	&amp;= \frac{3}{2} N k_B T\\
	&amp;= \frac{3}{2} \frac{\rho}{\mu m_p} V k_B T\end{aligned}\]</span> Then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\symbf{\nabla}p}{\bar{\rho}}
	&amp;= \frac{1}{\bar{\rho}}
	\left[ 
		\left( \pdv{p}{\rho} \right)_S \symbf{\nabla}\rho
		+ 
		\left( \pdv{p}{S} \right)_\rho \symbf{\nabla}S
	\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> Let <span class="math inline">\(c_s^2 = (\pdv*{p}{\rho})_S\)</span> be the adiabatic sound speed squared. Then we get <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\left( \pdv{p}{S} \right)_\rho = \frac{2}{3} \rho T\end{aligned}\]</span> and thus <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\symbf{\nabla}p}{\bar{\rho}}
	&amp;= c_s^2 \symbf{\nabla}\delta + \frac{2}{3} (1+\delta) T \symbf{\nabla}S\end{aligned}\]</span> The Euler equation can then be rewritten as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\pdv{\symbf{v}}{t} + \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \symbf{v} + \frac{1}{a} (\symbf{v} \cdot \symbf{\nabla}) \symbf{v}
	&amp;= - \frac{\symbf{\nabla}\Phi}{a} - \frac{c_s^2}{a} \frac{\symbf{\nabla}\delta}{1 + \delta} - \frac{2T}{3a} \symbf{\nabla}S\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="solving-the-fluid-equation" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Solving the fluid equation</h3>
<p>For small density perturbations <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> and small peculiar velocities <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{v}\)</span>, we can drop terms that are quadratic in these variables, such as <span class="math inline">\((\symbf{v} \cdot \symbf{\nabla}) \symbf{v}\)</span>. We get the linearized fluid equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\pdv{\delta}{t} + \frac{1}{a} \symbf{\nabla}\cdot\symbf{v} &amp;= 0\\
	\pdv{\symbf{v}}{t} + \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \symbf{v} &amp;= - \frac{\symbf{\nabla}\Phi}{a} - \frac{c_s^2}{a} \symbf{\nabla}\delta - \frac{2 \bar{T}}{3a} \symbf{\nabla}S\end{aligned}\]</span> We can combine them to get a single equation. First, take the derivative of the continuity equation. Then, use the Euler equation and the Poisson equation to get the following: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\pdv[2]{\delta}{t} + 2 \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \pdv{\delta}{t} &amp;= 4 \pi G \bar{\rho} \delta + \frac{c_s^2}{a^2} \laplacian\delta + \frac{2}{3} \frac{\bar{T}}{a^2} \laplacian S\end{aligned}\]</span> This is a second order differential equation. We take the Fourier transform: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\delta(\symbf{x},t) &amp;= \sum_{\symbf{k}} \delta_{\symbf{k}} \exp(i \symbf{k} \cdot \symbf{x})\\
	\delta_{\symbf{k}}(t) &amp;= \frac{1}{V} \int \delta(\symbf{x},t) \exp(-i \symbf{k} \cdot \symbf{x}) \dd{^3x},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is the volume of a sufficiently large box. The fluid equation then becomes <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dv[2]{\delta_{\symbf{k}}}{t} + 2 \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \dv{\delta_{\symbf{k}}}{t}
	&amp;= \left[4 \pi G \bar{\rho} - \frac{k^2 c_s^2}{a^2}\right] \delta_{\symbf{k}} - \frac{2}{3} k^2 \frac{\bar{T}}{a^2} S_{\symbf{k}}\end{aligned}\]</span> The Poisson equation in Fourier space is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	- k^2 \Phi_{\symbf{k}} &amp;= 4 \pi G \bar{\rho} a^2 \delta_{\symbf{k}}\end{aligned}\]</span> The fluid equation can now be solved for every <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{k}\)</span>-mode independently.</p>
<p>We need initial conditions to solve the fluid equation. There are two pressure terms, <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{\symbf{k}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_{\symbf{k}}\)</span>. We distinguish two types of initial conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\delta \neq 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\delta S = 0\)</span>: isentropic or adiabatic or curvature perturbations</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\delta = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\delta S \neq 0\)</span>: isocurvature perturbations</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Adiabatic perturbations are naturally generated by inflation, so we only consider those and set <span class="math inline">\(\delta S = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The fluid equation can now be simplified further: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dv[2]{\delta_{\symbf{k}}}{t} + 2 \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \dv{\delta_{\symbf{k}}}{t}
	&amp;= \left[4 \pi G \bar{\rho} - \frac{k^2 c_s^2}{a^2}\right] \delta_{\symbf{k}}\end{aligned}\]</span> Consider the case where the expansion of the fluid can be ignored, so <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a constant. Then <span class="math inline">\(\dot{a} = 0\)</span>, so a further term drops out: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dv[2]{\delta_{\symbf{k}}}{t}
	&amp;= \left[4 \pi G \bar{\rho} - \frac{k^2 c_s^2}{a^2}\right] \delta_{\symbf{k}}\\
	&amp;= - \omega^2 \delta_{\symbf{k}}\end{aligned}\]</span> This is simply the equation of motion of a harmonic oscillator. We can rewrite <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\omega^2
	&amp;= \left( \frac{c_s}{a} \right)^2 [k^2 - k_J^2]\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k_J\)</span> is the <span class="smallcaps">Jeans</span> wavenumber <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	k_J = \frac{a}{c_s} \sqrt{4 \pi G \bar{\rho}}.\end{aligned}\]</span> One can also define the Jeans wavelength <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\lambda_J = \frac{2 \pi a}{k_J},\end{aligned}\]</span> and the Jeans mass <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	M_J = \frac{\pi}{6} \bar{\rho} \lambda_J^3,\end{aligned}\]</span> which is the mass of a sphere with a radius of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_J/2\)</span> and density <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\rho}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-1" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Solutions</h3>
<p>We first consider the case where <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; k_J\)</span>, or equivalently <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &lt; \lambda_J\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(M &lt; M_J\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\omega^2 &gt; 0\)</span>, and the equation of motion gives us an oscillatory solution: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\delta_{\symbf{k}} \propto \exp(\pm i \omega t)
	\qquad \omega \in \mathbb{R}\end{aligned}\]</span> This means that density perturbations don’t grow, but just oscillate.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(k &lt; k_J\)</span>, the solution is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\delta_{\symbf{k}} \propto \exp(\pm \alpha t) \qquad \alpha \in \mathbb{R},\end{aligned}\]</span> which indicates exponentially decaying or growing modes. The growing modes lead to the growth of structure, which is called gravitational or Jeans instability. Once the perturbations become large, our assumptions are not valid any more, and we have to switch to non-linear perturbation theory.</p>
<h3 id="jeans-mass" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Jeans mass</h3>
<p>The Jeans mass is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	M_J
	&amp;= \frac{\pi}{6} \bar{\rho} \lambda_J^3\\
	&amp;= \frac{\pi^{5/2}}{6} \frac{c_s^3}{G^{3/2} \bar{\rho}^{1/2}}\end{aligned}\]</span> Before recombination, photons and baryons are tightly coupled, and they act as a single fluid. We get <span class="math inline">\(M_J \approx \num{e16} (\Omega_{b,0}h^2)^{-2} M_\odot\)</span>, which means that no baryonic perturbations smaller than a supercluster can grow before recombination.</p>
<p>After recombination, the baryons and the photons are decoupled. They have much smaller pressure, and <span class="math inline">\(M_J \approx \num{e5} (\Omega_{b,0}h^2)^{-1/2} M_\odot\)</span>. Perturbations with masses larger than a globular cluster can grow.</p>
<p>We also have to take into account the expansion of the universe, which we neglected up to now. Furthermore, these results do not consider dark matter, but only baryons.</p>
<h2 id="collisionless-gas">Collisionless gas</h2>
<p>We now consider a collisionless gas, such as dark matter. In this case, there is no reason to impose thermodynamic equilibrium, not even locally. As a result, we cannot describe the gas with the thermodynamic variables we used before, since they are only defined in (at least local) thermodynamic equilibrium. We thus need to take one step back and consider distribution functions <span class="math inline">\(f(\symbf{x}, \symbf{p}, t)\)</span>, whose dynamics are given by the collisionless Boltzmann equation, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dv{f}{t}
	&amp;= \pdv{f}{t} + \pdv{f}{p^i} \pdv{p^i}{t} + \pdv{f}{x^i} \pdv{x^i}{t}\\
	&amp;= 0.\end{aligned}\]</span> As before, we can take the moments of the distribution functions: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\langle Q \rangle = \frac{1}{n} \int \dd{^3p} Q f(\symbf{x}, \symbf{p}, t)\end{aligned}\]</span> with the comoving number density <span class="math inline">\(n(\symbf{x}, t) = \int \dd{^3p} f(\symbf{x}, \symbf{p}, t)\)</span>. Some moments are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The density <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\symbf{x}, t)\)</span> can be obtained with <span class="math inline">\(Q = m\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the mass of a particle.</p></li>
<li><p>The bulk velocity <span class="math inline">\(\langle v_i \rangle\)</span> can be obtained with <span class="math inline">\(Q = v_i = p_i/(m n)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>We take moments of the Boltzmann equation. One can show that one gets the same equations as the fluid equations: the continuity equation and the Euler equation, with the pressure gradient term replaced as follows: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\frac{\symbf{\nabla}_i p}{\rho}
	\to \sum_{j=1}^3 \pdv{}{x_j}
	\left[ (1+\delta) \sigma_{ij}^2 \right]\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\sigma_{ij} = \left\langle v_i v_j \right\rangle - \left\langle v_i \right\rangle \left\langle v_j \right\rangle\end{aligned}\]</span> The stress tensor is defined as <span class="math inline">\(\rho \sigma_{ij}^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the stress tensor is small, we get the fluid equations with <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{\nabla}p = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_s^2=0\)</span>, so a pressureless fluid.</p>
<p>On small scales, the stress tensor can be important. The large random velocities of the particles can make these particles diffuse and dampen the perturbations. This phenomenon is called <em>free streaming</em>. This is not important for cold dark matter, but it is important for hot dark matter.</p>
<h2 id="solutions-2">Solutions</h2>
<h3 id="collisionless-gas-1">Collisionless gas</h3>
<p>We assume adiabatic perturbations, neglect free streaming, and only consider cold dark matter. In the ideal fluid equations, we can set <span class="math inline">\(p=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_s^2 = 0\)</span>. We get <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dv[2]{\delta_{\symbf{k}}}{t}
	+ 2 \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \dv{\delta_{\symbf{k}}}{t}
	&amp;= 4 \pi \bar{\rho}_m \delta_{\symbf{k}}\end{aligned}\]</span> We consider solutions for an expanding universe and find the following solutions (homework):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The solution <span class="math inline">\(\delta_- \propto H(t)\)</span> is decaying, since <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> becomes smaller over time.</p></li>
<li><p>The growing solution is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		\delta_+ \propto H(t) \int_0^t \frac{\dd{t&#39;}}{a(t)^2 H(t&#39;)},
	\end{aligned}\]</span> which is a result of gravitational instability. This is similar to what we found before, but this time we did not neglect expansion. We define <span class="math inline">\(D(z) \propto \delta_+\)</span> the linear growth factor.</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Matter dominated case (<span class="math inline">\(\Omega_0 = \Omega_{m,0} = 1\)</span>): <span class="math inline">\(a \propto t^{2/3}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H \propto t^{-1}\)</span>. This yields <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		D \propto t^{2/3} \propto a
	\end{aligned}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>OCDM (<span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{m,0} &lt; 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{\Lambda,0} = 0\)</span>) and ΛCDM (<span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{m,0} + \Omega_{\Lambda,0} = 1\)</span>): We get an analytical solution where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> grows slower than <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. The faster expansion from ΛCDM slows down the growth of structure.</p></li>
<li><p>In the general case, there is no analytical solution. The growth factor usually grows slower than the exponential growth we found in the non-expanding gravitational instability case. In other words, the universe expansion slows down with the growth of structure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at how the gravitational potential grows, because we will need that result later. The Poisson equation in Fourier space is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	- k^2 \Phi_{\symbf{k}} = 4 \pi G \bar{\rho} \delta_{\symbf{k}},\end{aligned}\]</span> which can be rearranged to <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Phi_{\symbf{k}}
	&amp;\propto a^2 \bar{\rho}_m \delta_{\symbf{k}}\\
	&amp;\propto a^2 a^{-3} D(a) \\
	&amp;\propto \frac{D(a)}{a}\end{aligned}\]</span> This means that <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\symbf{k}}\)</span> is constant in the matter dominated case, and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\symbf{k}}\)</span> decays in the OCDM and ΛCDM cases at late times.</p>
<h3 id="two-non-relativistic-components">Two non-relativistic components</h3>
<p>We consider collisionless dark matter and collisionfull baryons. We assume that the pressureless dark matter dominates the matter density, so <span class="math inline">\(\rho_\text{tot} \approx \rho_\text{dm}\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are now two differential equations: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\dv[2]{\delta_{\text{dm}, \symbf{k}}}{t}
	+ 2 \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \dv{\delta_{\text{dm}, \symbf{k}}}{t}
	&amp;= 4 \pi G \bar{\rho}_m \delta_{\text{dm}, \symbf{k}}\\
	\dv[2]{\delta_{\text{b}, \symbf{k}}}{t}
	+ 2 \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \dv{\delta_{\text{b}, \symbf{k}}}{t}
	+ \frac{k^2 c_s^2}{a^2} \delta_{\text{b},\symbf{k}}
	&amp;= 4 \pi G \bar{\rho}_m \delta_{\text{dm}, \symbf{k}}\end{aligned}\]</span> The first equation is the same as in the previous section, because the low-density baryons don’t influence the dark matter much. To get analytical solutions, we assume that we are in the matter dominated case, and that <span class="math inline">\(c_s^2 a\)</span> is constant.</p>
<p>Since the dark matter equation is the same, it has the same solution, with a growing mode <span class="math inline">\(D(t) \propto a\)</span> in a matter dominated universe.</p>
<p>For the baryons <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\delta_{\text{b},\symbf{k}}(t)
	&amp;= \frac{\delta_{\text{dm},\symbf{k}}(t)}{1 + (k/k_J)^2},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k_J = a/c_s \sqrt{4 \pi G \bar{\rho}}\)</span> is the Jeans wavenumber. From this equation, we see that the baryon perturbations are equal to the dark matter perturbations for small <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. For large <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, pressure becomes more important, and the baryon perturbations will be smaller.</p>
<h5 id="acoustic-oscillations" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Acoustic oscillations</h5>
<p>We have just seen that baryon behaviour becomes a lot more interesting at smaller length scales, where pressure is higher. This leads to oscillations and damping of the amplitude of the perturbations. One can show that the baryon density of a given mode <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{k}\)</span> oscillates like <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\delta_{\text{b},\symbf{k}} \propto \exp(\frac{i k c_s t}{a}) + \text{constant},\end{aligned}\]</span> which corresponds to sound waves, which is why they are called <em>acoustic oscillations</em>.</p>
<h5 id="collisional-damping" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Collisional damping</h5>
<p>Before recombination on small scales, the perturbations are damped by imperfect coupling between baryons and photons. This leads to diffusion of the photons, which suppresses perturbations on small scales. The effect is called <em>collisional damping</em> or <em>Silk</em> <em>damping</em>.</p>
<h2 id="relativistic-perturbations">Relativistic perturbations</h2>
<p>For a full treatment of cosmological perturbations, we need a relativistic treatment. We will only give a sketch of the formalism here.</p>
<p>The Einstein equations give the time evolution of space-time. The perturbed version of these equations is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\bar{G}_{\mu\nu} + \delta G_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi G (\bar{T}_{\mu\nu} + \delta T_{\mu\nu}),\end{aligned}\]</span> where the variables with a bar are the background solutions from the FRW metric, and the <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>-terms are sufficiently small perturbations, so that we can treat them with linear perturbation theory.</p>
<p>In order to calculate <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, we need a metric, which we assume to be of the form <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	g_{\mu \nu} = \bar{g}_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{g}\)</span> is the FRW metric, and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is a again a small perturbation. The perturbation <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> can again be decomposed, according to the behaviour of their components under coordinate changes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tensor perturbations correspond to gravitational waves, which are important for the polarization of the CMB. However, they are too small to have been detected directly from the CMB.</p></li>
<li><p>Vector perturbations are vorticity modes, which decay. They are thus not very important in cosmology.</p></li>
<li><p>Scalar perturbations can be thought of perturbations in the gravitational potential. They play a central role in structure formation, so we will focus solely on them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The stress energy tensor can be related to the distribution function of different components <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> of the universe, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	T_{\mu\nu} &amp;= \sum_{i} T^{i}_{\mu\nu}\\
	T^{i}_{\mu\nu} &amp;= \int \frac{\dd{^3p}}{(2\pi)^3 E} p_\mu p_\nu f^i(\symbf{x},\symbf{p},t),\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> can be found from the Boltzmann equation. The distribution function can also be spilt into a background and a small perturbation: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	f^i = \bar{f}^i + \delta f^i.\end{aligned}\]</span> These species <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> are dark matter, baryons, photons, neutrinos, and potentials of the metric perturbations. We only consider scalar perturbations. All these species interact with each other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All species interact with the metric.</p></li>
<li><p>Photons and electrons interact through Compton scattering.</p></li>
<li><p>Electrons and protons interact through Coulomb scattering.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other forces, such as the weak interaction, are neglected, since they are too rare or weak.</p>
<p>The resulting set of linear differential equations are called the <em>linearised Einstein-Boltzmann equations</em>. They have no analytical solution in general, but there are analytical solutions in asymptotic limits.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-in-asymptotic-limits" class="unnumbered unnumbered">Solutions in asymptotic limits</h3>
<p>For each <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{k}\)</span> mode, the equations can be solved separately. There are several important scales:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(k^{-1}\)</span> is the comoving wavelength scale of the <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{k}\)</span>-mode</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\chi_h\)</span> is the comoving horizon</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(a_\text{eq}\)</span> is the scale factor at matter-radiation equality, or <span class="math inline">\(a_{\text{eq2}}\)</span> at matter-dark energy equality</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\chi_h(a_\text{eq})\)</span> is the size of the horizon at matter-radiation equality</p></li>

We consider the evolution of a very large and a very small mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Large modes (<span class="math inline">\(k \ll k_\text{eq}\)</span>) are constant in the radiation era. When entering the matter era, they lose about 10 % of their amplitude, but then remain constant.</p></li>
<li><p>Small modes (<span class="math inline">\(k\gg k_\text{eq}\)</span>) decay in the radiation era, but remain constant in the matter era. In the dark energy era, they evolve as <span class="math inline">\(D(a)/a\)</span>, which we have already seen in the Newtonian treatment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, small modes are suppressed, while large modes stay mostly constant.</p>
<h2 id="transfer-function">Transfer function</h2>
<p>We can describe the transition from early times to the matter dominated era by a <em>transfer function</em>. We write the potential at late times (<span class="math inline">\(a \gg a_\text{eq}\)</span>) as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Phi_k(a) = \frac{9}{10} \Phi_{p, k} T(k) \frac{D(a)}{a}\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{p, k}\)</span> is the primordial potential, which is the potential at initial conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(T(k)\)</span> is the transfer functions, which obeys <span class="math inline">\(T \to 1\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(k \to 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(D(a)\)</span> is the growth factor, normalized such that <span class="math inline">\(D(a) = a\)</span> in the matter era.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(9/10\)</span> factor is the large scale suppression which we have seen in the previous diagram.</p></li>

<li><p>Jeans instability for <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; k_J\)</span> inhabits growth, and instead leads to oscillations.

<h2 id="primordial-perturbations">Primordial perturbations</h2>
<p>Inflation also gives a mechanism to generate primordial perturbations. Remember that we proposed an inflaton field <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>, which is in a false vacuum configuration at the beginning, leading to vacuum energy. This drives an accelerated expansion. We required that the scale factor grew by <span class="math inline">\(a_e/a_i &gt; e^{60}\)</span> during inflation, so small features are blown up to macroscopic features. These act as the initial perturbations for formations of structure.</p>
<p>The quantum harmonic oscillator is described by the Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 x^2,\end{aligned}\]</span> which gives rise to equally spaced energy levels <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	E_n = \frac{\hbar}{m \omega}
	\left( m + \frac{1}{2} \right),\end{aligned}\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n \in  \left\{{0, 1, 2, \dots} \right\}\)</span>. We consider a state <span class="math inline">\(\ket{n}\)</span>, which deviates from its average position by <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\expval{x^2} = \expval{x^2}{n}
	= \frac{\hbar}{m\omega}
	\left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right).\end{aligned}\]</span> We can see that even for the ground state <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span>, fluctuations exist. For inflation, each <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{k}\)</span>-mode <span class="math inline">\(\Phi_{\text{p},\symbf{k}}\)</span> acts like a quantum harmonic oscillator.</p>
<p>We define the power spectrum as the second moment of the Fourier-transformed primordial potential, <span class="math inline">\(P(k) \propto \langle{\relax {\Phi_{\symbf{p},k}}^2}\rangle\)</span>. One can show that <span class="math inline">\(P(k) \propto k^{n-4}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is arbitrarily close to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and depends on the slow roll parameters <span class="math inline">\(\dv*{V}{\phi}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dv*[2]{V}{\phi}\)</span>. The case <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span> is called <em>scale invariant</em> or <em>Harison-Zel’dovich</em>.</p>
<p>Inflation generically predicts the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The perturbations are adiabatic, which was explained in the previous chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>The perturbations are Gaussian, which will be explained in the next section.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cosmological-field-statistics">Cosmological field statistics</h2>
<p>The density contrast <span class="math inline">\(\delta(\symbf{x}, t)\)</span> can be measured more-or-less accurately by observations. We can also get a simulated density contrast from a model. There is, however, a problem when trying to compare the measurements with the prediction of the model, since we are attempting to compare two different realizations of a random quantum process.</p>
<p>One way to solve this problem is to compare not the particular density contrasts, but the underlying probability distributions. For a given model, these do not suffer from any randomness, and can therefore be compared directly.</p>
<p>We divide the universe into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> cells, which are centred at positions <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{x}_1, \dots, \symbf{x}_n\)</span>. The random perturbation field is then characterized by the probability distribution function, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Prob_x(\delta_1, \dots, \delta_n) \dd{\delta_1} \cdots \dd{\delta_n},\end{aligned}\]</span> which is the probability that the field <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> has values in the range <span class="math inline">\(\delta_i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\delta_i + \dd{\delta_i}\)</span> at positions <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{x}_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>As we see, this function <span class="math inline">\(\Prob_x\)</span> could be very complicated, potentially taking a huge number of arguments as input. To simplify the situation, we look only at some statistical moments of <span class="math inline">\(\Prob_x\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="statistical-moments">Statistical moments</h3>
<p>A statistical moment is a quantity that describes the shape of a function. If the function is a probability distribution, some well-known examples of moments are the expected value and the variance.</p>
<p>The moments of a probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(\Prob_x\)</span> are defined as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\left\langle \delta_1^{\ell_1} \dots \delta_n^{\ell_n} \right\rangle
	&amp;= \int \delta_1^{\ell_1} \cdots \delta_n^{\ell_n}
	\Prob_x(\delta_1, \dots, \delta_n) \dd{\delta_1} \cdots \dd{\delta_n},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\ell_i \in  \left\{{0, 1, 2, \dots} \right\}\)</span>. Because of the cosmological principle, all moments are invariant under spatial translation and rotation.</p>
<p>The first moment is the expected value, <span class="math inline">\(\left\langle \delta \right\rangle = 0\)</span>, because the density distribution is expected to be zero by assumption.</p>
<p>Some more moments are the variance <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2 = \left\langle \delta^2 \right\rangle\)</span>, and the two-point correlation function <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\xi(x) = \left\langle \delta_1 \delta_2 \right\rangle, \quad \text{with } x = \relax {\symbf{x}_1 - \symbf{x}_2}.\end{aligned}\]</span> Note that <span class="math inline">\(\xi(0) = \sigma^2\)</span>, and that <span class="math inline">\(\xi(x)\)</span> only depends on the distance between <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{x}_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{x}_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The same analysis can be performed in Fourier space, where we define the power spectrum, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	P(k)
	&amp;\mathrel{\vcenter{\baselineskip 0.5ex \lineskiplimit 0pt
			\hbox{\scriptsize.}\hbox{\scriptsize.}}}%
	=V \left\langle \relax {\delta_k}^2 \right\rangle,\end{aligned}\]</span> which is the variance in Fourier space. It can be related to the two-point correlation function: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	P(k)
	&amp;= \int \xi(\relax {\symbf{x}}) \exp(-i\symbf{k}\cdot\symbf{x}) \dd{^3 \symbf{x}},\\
	\xi(r)
	&amp;= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int P(k) \exp(i \symbf{k}\cdot\symbf{r}) \dd{^3\symbf{k}}.\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The variance in position space can then be written in terms of the power function, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\left\langle \delta^2 \right\rangle
	&amp;= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^3} \int P(k) \dd{^3\symbf{k}}\\
	&amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi^2} \int P(k) k^2 \dd{k}\\
	&amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi^2} \int P(k) k^3 \dd{\ln(k)}.\end{aligned}\]</span> We define <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^2(k) = k^3 P(k)/2\pi^2\)</span>, which is the contribution to the variance per <span class="math inline">\(\ln(k)\)</span> interval.</p>
<h3 id="smoothing">Smoothing</h3>
<p>If we only want to analyse features larger than a certain size limit, we convolve the density contrast with a smoothing kernel. An example for such a kernel is the top hat sphere, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	W_R(r) = 
	\begin{cases}
	\frac{3}{4\pi R^3} &amp; \text{if } r \leq R,\\
	0 &amp; \text{otherwise}.
	\end{cases}\end{aligned}\]</span> The smoothed field <span class="math inline">\(\delta_R\)</span> is then defined as a convolution of the original field and the kernel: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\delta_R(\symbf{x},t)
	&amp;= \int \dd{^3 \symbf{y}} \delta(\symbf{y},t) W_R(\symbf{x}-\symbf{y}),\end{aligned}\]</span> which is commonly written <span class="math inline">\(\delta_R = \delta *W_R\)</span>.</p>
<p>The variance of the smoothed field is then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\left\langle \delta_R^2 \right\rangle
	&amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi^2} \int P(k) \widetilde{W}_R^2 k^2 \dd{k},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\widetilde{W}_R\)</span> is the Fourier transform of <span class="math inline">\(W_R\)</span>, which is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\widetilde{W}_R(k)
	&amp;= \frac{3}{k R^2} [\sin(kR) - kR \cos(kR)].\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="gaussian-fields">Gaussian fields</h3>
<p>The probability distribution can be fully recovered if all of its statistical moments are known, as long as the distribution is homogeneous and isotropic. <em>Gaussian fields</em>, where <span class="math inline">\(\Prob(\delta(\symbf{x}_1) \cdots \delta(\symbf{x}_n))\)</span> is proportional to a multivariate Gaussian function, can still be fully recovered if only the two-point correlation function is known. Consequently, higher order moments can be expressed in terms of the two-point correlation function.</p>
<p>In the standard model of cosmology, we assume that the perturbation fields are initially Gaussian, but they can evolve to non-Gaussian fields later. Then, the initial power spectrum of the perturbation field is all we need to know to fully characterize the field.</p>
<h2 id="matter-power-spectrum">Matter power spectrum</h2>
<p>We can now combine the results of the previous three sections. The Poisson equation is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	- k^2 \Phi_{\symbf{k}}(a)
	&amp;= 4 \pi G \bar{\rho}_\text{m} a^2 \delta_{\symbf{k}}(a),\end{aligned}\]</span> which can be rearranged and combined with the definition of the transfer function to <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\delta_{\symbf{k}}(a)
	&amp;= \frac{2}{5} \frac{k^2}{\Omega_m H_0^2} \Phi_{p, \symbf{k}} T(k) D(a),\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a \gg a_\text{eq}\)</span>, as we required when we introduced the transfer function. The primordial power spectrum obeys <span class="math inline">\(P(k) \propto k^{n-4}\)</span>, and it is commonly written as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	P_{\Phi_p}(k) = \frac{50 \pi^2}{9 k^3} 
	\left( \frac{k}{H_0} \right)^{n-1}
	\delta_{H}^2 
	\left( \frac{\Omega_m}{D(a=1)} \right)^2,\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\delta_H\)</span> is a normalization parameter. Combining all these, we get <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	P(k,a)
	&amp;= V \left\langle \relax {\delta(k,a)}^2 \right\rangle\\
	&amp;= 2 \pi^2 \delta_H^2 
	\frac{k^n}{H_0^{n+3}}
	T(k)^2
	\left( \frac{D(a)}{D(a=1)} \right)^2.\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>The matter power spectrum is plotted as a function of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for different cosmological models in <a href="#fig:k-power" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:k-power">[fig:k-power]</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the ΛCDM model, the turnover is at <span class="math inline">\(k_\text{eq} \propto \Omega_m h^2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the SCDM model (no cosmological constant, compensated with larger <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_m\)</span>), the turnover is at a higher <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the HDM model, free streaming suppresses perturbations on small scales, so the power at large <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> falls off quickly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, by measuring the power spectrum on small scales, we can distinguish the models fairly well.</p>

<li><p>At large scales, <span class="math inline">\(P(k) \propto k^n\)</span>, which is essentially the same as the primordial power spectrum.</p></li>
<li><p>The peak is at <span class="math inline">\(k_\text{eq} \approx \SI{0.0073}{\per\mega\parsec} \Omega_m h^2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>At intermediate scales, there are baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). These are at a scale of 0.04 /M, corresponding to a size of the horizon of 150 M, which is called the sound horizon.</p></li>
<li><p>At small scales, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
		P(k)
		&amp;\propto k^n T(k)^2\\
		&amp;\propto k^{n-4} \ln
		\left( \frac{k}{k_\text{eq}} \right)^2
	\end{aligned}\]</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>At small scales, the amplitude of the perturbations become large, and the linear model no longer holds. As a result, <span class="math inline">\(P(k)\)</span> needs non-linear corrections. We define <span class="math inline">\(k_\text{NL}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta(k_\text{NL})^2 = 1\)</span>. We find that <span class="math inline">\(k_\text{NL}\)</span> decreases as <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> increases, so small scales become non-linear first, and large scales later. Small objects form earlier, and large objects form later by merging of smaller ones. This is called a <em>hierarchical model</em> for structure formation.</p>
<p>First, galaxies, and then groups were starting to form. Today, galaxy clusters, with a mass of <span class="math inline">\(\num{e14} M_\odot\)</span>, are starting to form. Superclusters are not collapsing yet, but should do so later.</p>
<h2 id="cosmic-microwave-background-anisotropies">Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies</h2>
<p>The CMB gives us a picture of the universe at last scattering, which happened at <span class="math inline">\(z_* \approx \num{1100}\)</span>. While the spectrum is very close to a blackbody spectrum, with a temperature of <span class="math inline">\(T = \SI{2.728(2)}{\kelvin}\)</span> today, there are small anisotropies with an amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T / T \approx \num{e-4}\)</span>, as shown in <a href="#fig:cmb-anisotropy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:cmb-anisotropy">[fig:cmb-anisotropy]</a>.</p>

<p><img src="img/ch-03/cmb-anisotropy.jpeg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>During recombination, protons and electrons combined to hydrogen. We have defined the fraction of free electrons <span class="math inline">\(X_e\)</span>, which decreases during recombination, see <a href="#fig:recombination" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:recombination">[fig:recombination]</a>.The interaction strength between photons and electrons can be characterized by the optical depth, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\tau_T(t) = \int_0^t n_e \sigma_T \dd{t},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_T\)</span> is the Thomson scattering cross-section. The optical depth is a measure of opacity for the photons.</p>
<p>For convenience, we define the conformal time <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	c \dd{t} = a \dd{\tau}
	\implies \tau(t) = \int_0^t \frac{c \dd{t&#39;}}{a(t&#39;)}.\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We write the temperature as a <span class="math inline">\(T(\symbf{x}, \hat{\symbf{q}}, \tau)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\symbf{x}\)</span> is our position in space, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\symbf{q}}\)</span> is the direction in which the photons are travelling, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the conformal time. We define the small temperature deviation <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> from the uniform background temperature <span class="math inline">\(\bar{T}\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	T(\symbf{x}, \hat{\symbf{q}}, \tau) = \bar{T}(\tau) [1 + \Theta(\symbf{x}, \hat{\symbf{q}}, \tau)].\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>First, we decompose the temperature deviation into spherical harmonics, <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Theta(\symbf{x}, \hat{\symbf{q}}, \tau)
	&amp;= \sum_{\ell=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} a_{\ell,m}(\symbf{x}, \tau) Y_{\ell m}(\hat{\symbf{q}}),\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	a_{\ell m}(\symbf{x}, \tau)
	&amp;= \int \dd{\Omega} \Theta(\symbf{x}, \hat{\symbf{q}}, \tau) Y^*_{\ell m}(\hat{\symbf{q}}) 	\end{aligned}\]</span> are the basis coefficients, and <span class="math inline">\(Y_{\ell m}\)</span> are the spherical harmonics.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is just one possible outcome of a random quantum process, we again have to fall back to statistical quantities in order to compare measurements with models. We thus define the angular power spectrum <span class="math inline">\(c_\ell = \left\langle \relax {a_{\ell m}}^2 \right\rangle\)</span> as a moment of the spherical basis coefficients, where we set <span class="math inline">\(\tau = \tau_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>With a Fourier transform, we get <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(\symbf{x}, \hat{\symbf{q}}, \tau) \to \Theta(\symbf{k}, \hat{\symbf{q}}, \tau)\)</span>. We define <span class="math inline">\(\mu = \hat{\symbf{q}} \cdot \symbf{k}\)</span>, and <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Theta_\ell(k, z)
	&amp;= \frac{1}{(-i)^\ell}
	\int_{-1}^1 \frac{\dd{\mu}}{\tau} \mathcal{P}_\ell(\mu) \Theta(\symbf{k}, \hat{\symbf{q}}, \tau),\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_\ell\)</span> are Legendre polynomials. Then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	c_\ell
	&amp;= \frac{2 V}{\pi} \int \dd{k} k^2 \left\langle \relax {\Theta_\ell(\symbf{k}, \tau_0)}^2 \right\rangle.\end{aligned}\]</span> We would like to relate this quantity, which we defined at <span class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span>, to its value at an earlier time <span class="math inline">\(z_*\)</span>. Using the solution to the Einstein-Boltzmann equation, and assuming instantaneous decoupling, we get <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\Theta_\ell(k, \tau_0)
	&amp;= [\Theta_0(k, \tau_*) + \Psi(k, \tau_*)]
	\mathcal{j}_\ell [k(\tau_0 - \tau_*)]\\
	&amp;+ 3 \Theta_1(k, \tau_*) 
	\left[ \mathcal{j}_{\ell-1} [k(\tau_0-\tau_*)]
	- \frac{(\ell+1) \mathcal{j}_\ell[k(\tau_0-\tau_*)]}{k (\tau_0-\tau_*)}
	\right]\\
	&amp;+ \int_0^{\tau_0} \dd{\tau} e^{-\tau_T}
	[\dot{\Psi}(k,\tau) - \dot{\Phi}(k, \tau)]
	\mathcal{j}_\ell [k(\tau_0-\tau_*)]
	,\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{j}_l\)</span> are Bessel functions. We now analyse the terms.</p>
<p>The first term is the <em>Sachs-Wolfe term</em>, <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_0 + \Psi\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_0\)</span> is the monopole, which is the mean temperature at decoupling. <span class="math inline">\(\Psi\)</span> is the gravitational potential at decoupling. This term describes that photons have to climb out of the gravitational potential, which redshifts them. Fluctuations in the potential thus influence the temperature of the photons we see today.</p>
<p>The second term is a function of the dipole <span class="math inline">\(\Theta_1\)</span>, which is related to the bulk velocity of photons at last scattering. This is called the <em>Doppler term</em> along the line of sight.</p>
<p>The third term involves <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\Phi}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\Psi}\)</span>, which are time derivatives of gravitational potentials. We saw that, in the matter era, both derivatives are zero. However, they can be non-zero if dark matter and curvature are present. This term is called the <em>integrated Sachs-Wolf term</em> (ISW).</p>
<p>The theoretical model of the angular power spectrum and several measurements are shown in <a href="#fig:power-spectrum" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:power-spectrum">[fig:power-spectrum]</a>. We can see that the most powerful mode has a scale of around 1 °, which can also be seen in <a href="#fig:cmb-anisotropy" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:cmb-anisotropy">[fig:cmb-anisotropy]</a>.</p>

<h4 id="asymptotic-limits">Asymptotic limits</h4>
<p>We now analyse the different areas in the angular power spectrum.</p>
<p>At large scales, where <span class="math inline">\(k \ll \chi_h^{-1}(z_*)\)</span>, we get for the Sachs-Wolfe term <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	C_\ell^\text{SW} \propto \delta_H^2 \frac{
	\Gamma\left(\ell+\frac{n-1}{2}\right)
	\Gamma\left(\frac{9-n}{2}\right) 
	}{
	\Gamma\left(\ell+\frac{5-n}{2}\right)
	\Gamma\left(\frac{3+n}{2}\right)
	},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\delta_H\)</span> is a normalization factor, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the spectral index in the power law. For <span class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span>, we get <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	C_\ell^{\text{SW}} \propto \delta_H^2 \frac{1}{\ell(\ell+1)},\end{aligned}\]</span> so <span class="math inline">\(\ell(\ell+1) C_\ell\)</span> is constant, which is why the vertical axis in the plot was chosen in such a way.</p>
<p>At intermediate scales, we see acoustic oscillations. We have already seen this in the ideal fluid equations, where we found baryon-photon oscillations proportional to <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\exp(\frac{i k c_s t}{a})
	= \exp(i k c_s \tau)\end{aligned}\]</span> at decoupling <span class="math inline">\(z_*\)</span>. The peaks are found at <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	k_m = \frac{m \pi}{L_s(\tau_\star)},\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(L_s(\tau_\star) \approx c_s(\tau_\star) \tau_\star\)</span> is the sound horizon at decoupling, and <span class="math inline">\(m \in  \left\{{1, 2, \dots} \right\}\)</span>. Remember that <span class="math inline">\(\Theta = L_\text{comoving} / r(\chi)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the comoving angular diameter distance. The comoving distance which is relevant here is <span class="math inline">\(L_\text{comoving} \approx k_m^{-1}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\ell \approx 1/\theta\)</span>. We thus find <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\ell_m 
	&amp;\approx k_m r(\chi_*)\\
	&amp;= m \pi \frac{r(\chi_*)}{L_s(\chi_*)}.\end{aligned}\]</span> We find the first peak at <span class="math inline">\(\ell \approx 200\)</span> for the ΛCDM model.</p>
<p>On small scales, we see Silk damping, where oscillations are damped because of imperfect coupling between photons and baryons. This occurs at <span class="math inline">\(\ell &gt; 2000\)</span>.</p>
<p>In summary, we see that measurements of the CMB power spectrum can be used to put constraints on cosmological models. The results are shown in <a href="#tab:constraints" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:constraints">[tab:constraints]</a>. Similarly, we can also measure the statistics of the polarization of the CMB.</p>
<p>As an example, we look at the measurement of curvature. The first peak is at a position <span class="math inline">\(\ell_{m=1} \approx k_p r(\chi_*)\)</span>. We assume that <span class="math inline">\(L_s(z_*)\)</span> is constant, then we have <span class="math inline">\(\ell_{m=1} \propto r(\chi_*)\)</span>. This depends on <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="galaxy-clustering">Galaxy Clustering</h2>
<p>We can find density perturbations at low redshift by measuring the clustering of galaxies. Unfortunately, we can only see visible matter, such as galaxies, whereas models predict the total mass distribution, which includes dark matter. To correct for this galaxy bias, we introduce the simple relation <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
	\delta_g = b(k, z, \text{galaxy type}) \delta,\end{aligned}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\delta_g = (n_g - \bar{n}_g)/\bar{n}_g\)</span> is the galaxy overdensity, <span class="math inline">\(\delta = (\rho-\bar{\rho})/\bar{\rho}\)</span> is the dark matter overdensity, and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the bias. The bias depends on the galaxy sample, the scale <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and redshift <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. Fortunately, on large scales, the bias is mostly scale independent.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of galaxy surveys:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Imaging surveys, such as POSS/APM, DES, and SDSS, measure the position and shape of galaxies.</p></li>
<li><p>Spectroscopy surveys, such as SDSS, 2DF, and Wiggle-z, measure the position and redshift of galaxies.

From the residual plot, we see that even the baryon acoustic oscillations are well resolved. These are fixed in comoving coordinates, so they can function as a standard ruler.</p>
<p>We can measure the two-dimensional clustering with an imaging survey such as APM, as shown in <a href="#fig:apm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:apm">[fig:apm]</a>. This can be used to rule out HDM or bayron-only models. The current measurements confirm the ΛCDM model, even though there are still small deviations, which come from the scale dependence of the bias factor.</p>
