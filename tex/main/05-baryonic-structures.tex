\section{State and distribution of baryons}


We want to include baryons in the study of non-linear structure formation.

\subsection{Evolution of baryons}
Before recombination and decoupling, the baryons were an ionized plasma.

After recombination, they are mostly neutral and in atomic form. At that point, there is little emission, which is why this period is called the Dark Ages.

At later times ($z \approx 6$ -- $20$), the first stars start to form, which emit UV photons that re-ionize the baryons and end the Dark Ages. This is called the Epoch of Reionization (EoR).

Following this, the baryons continue to participate in structure formation, driven by dark matter.
